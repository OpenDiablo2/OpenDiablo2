## Contributing

If you find something you'd like to fix that's obviously broken, create a branch, commit your code, and submit a pull request.
If it's a new or missing feature you'd like to see, add an issue, and be descriptive!

If you'd like to help out and are not quite sure how, you can look through any open issues and tasks, or ask for tasks on our discord server.

**As of Oct. 26, 2020 we will no longer be accepting pull requests that introduce lint errors.**

We use `golangci-lint` to catch lint errors, and we require all contributors to install and use it.
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/).
