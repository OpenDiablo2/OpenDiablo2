## Configuration

The engine is configured via the `config.json` file. 
By default, the configuration assumes that you have installed Diablo 2 and the expansion via the official Blizzard Diablo 2 installers using the default file paths.
If you are not on Windows, or have installed the game in a different location, the base path may have to be adjusted.
