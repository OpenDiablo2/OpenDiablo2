// Package d2math provides mathematical functions not included in Golang's standard math library.
/*
The decimal numeric type used is float64.

Math also dictates the threshold for approximate equality (d2math.Epsilon). This is currently used both for moving
entities and for approximate floating point equality in vector functions. See d2vector.*/
