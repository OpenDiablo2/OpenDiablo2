// SuperUniqueRecord Defines the unique monsters and their properties.
// SuperUnique monsters are boss monsters which always appear at the same places
// and always have the same base special abilities
// with the addition of one or two extra ones per difficulty (Nightmare provides one extra ability, Hell provides two).
// Notable examples are enemies such as Corpsefire, Pindleskin or Nihlathak.
type SuperUniqueRecord struct {

	// id of the SuperUnique Monster. Each SuperUnique Monster must use a different id.
	// It also serves as the string to use in the 'Place' field of MonPreset.txt
	Key string // Superunique

	// Name for this SuperUnique which must be retrieved from a .TBL file
	Name string

	// the base monster type of the SuperUnique, refers to the "Key" field in monstats.go ("Id" column in the MonStats.txt)
	Class string

	// This is the "hardcoded index".
	// Vanilla SuperUniques in the game ranges from 0 to 65. Some of them have some hardcoded stuffs attached.
	// NOTE: It is also possible to create new SuperUniques with hardcoded stuff attached. To do this, you can use a hcIx from 0 to 65.
	// Example A: If you create a new SuperUnique with a hcIdx of 42 (Shenk the Overseer) then whatever its Class,
	// this SuperUnique will have 20 Enslaved as minions (exactly like the vanilla Shenk, and in spite of NOT being Shenk).
	// Example B: If you want a simple new SuperUnique, you must use a hcIdx greater than 65,
	// because greater indexes don't exist in the code and therefore your new boss won't have anything special attached
	HcIdx string

	// This field forces the SuperUnique to use a special set of sounds for attacks, taunts, death etc.
	// The Countess is a clear and noticeable example of this. The MonSound set is taken from MonSounds.txt.
	MonSound string

	// These three fields assign special abilities so SuperUnique monsters such as "Fire Enchanted" or "Stone Skin".
	// These fields refers to the Id's corresponding to the properties in MonUMod.txt.
	// Here is the list of available properties.
	// 0.  None

	// true means it will spawn exactly where expected.

	// Specifies if this SuperUnique can spawn more than once in the same game.
