## About this project

OpenDiablo2 is an ARPG game engine in the same vein of the 2000's games, and supports playing Diablo 2. The engine is written in C# and is cross platform. However, please note that this project does not ship with the assets or content required to play Diablo 2. You must have a legally purchased copy of [Diablo 2](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii) and its expansion [Lord of Destruction](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction) installed on your computer in order to run that game on this engine. If you have an original copy of the disks, those files should work fine as well.

Currently we are working on features necessary to play Diablo 2 in its entireity, but will then expand with tools and plugin support to allow modding, as well as writing completely new games with the engine.

Currently we have the main menu, credits screen, hero selection screen, map rendering, character animations, the beginnings of map generation, some equipment management, and a client/server stack. This project is still early in development and is not yet at a playable state.

Please note that **this game is neither developed by, nor endorsed by Blizzard or its parent company Activision**.

## Building On Windows
To build this engine, you simply need to have [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed with C#/Windows support. Also make sure that only the x64 architecture is selected as we are not shipping 32-bit versions of SDL currently.

## Building On Linux
You need to have MonoDevelop installed, as well as any depenencies for that. You also need LibSDL2 installed (installing via your favorite package manager should be fine).

## Command Line Parameters
| Long Name    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| --datapath   | (-p) Defines the path where the data files can be found      |
| --hwmouse    | Use the hardware mouse instead of software                   |
| --mousescale | When hardware mouse is enabled, this defines the pixel scale of the mouse. No effect for software mode |
| --fullscreen | (-f) When set, the game launches in full screen mode at 800x600. |

By default OpenDiablo2 assumes the media files are in the same folder as itself. At minimum you'll most likely want to specify this option:

```-p "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II"```

Substitute the path with wherever you have installed Diablo 2 and its expansions.

When running via VisualStudio, go to the debug section of the OpenDiablo2 project and specify the command line options there. At minimum you'll want to specify the path to the data files.
