[OpenDiablo2](https://opendiablo2.com/) is an ARPG game engine in the same vein of the 2000's games, and supports playing Diablo 2.

The engine is written in Go and is cross platform.

> The project does not ship with the assets or content required to play Diablo 2.
You must have a legally purchased copy of [Diablo 2](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii) and its expansion [Lord of Destruction](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction) installed on your computer in order to run that game on this engine.

If you like to contribute to OpenDiablo2, please be so kind to read our [Contribution Policy](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
